Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter.

Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Random Player Assignment: The game randomly assigns 'X' or 'O' to the first player.
Player Turns: Players take turns marking spaces on the grid.
Win Detection: The game detects when a player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
Tie Detection: If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game detects a tie.
Restart Option: Players can restart the game at any time to play again.
How to Play
Run the program.
The game window will open, showing the Tic-Tac-Toe grid and indicating which player's turn it is.
Click on an empty space in the grid to mark it with your symbol.
Continue taking turns with the other player until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
To start a new game, click the "Restart" button.
